# cellAnnotations

Run the GUI.py file to execute the GUI with widgets. <br />
Choose 'Preprocess Img' button for choosing an image file to split into nine smaller segments for easier annotation. <br />
Then, choose 'Crowdsource' and Select 'toWeb' folder for publishing the contents into AWS MTurk. <br />
After annotations have been done, choose 'Retrieve Results' for retrieving the annotations. <br />
You should be able to see the results stored in a text file in the same folder. <br />

After you have retrieved annotations, make sure the nine segments are in one folder and choose 'Postprocess Img' for concatnating the segmented images into one final image. <br />
